# WriteLines (CLI)
> A C# training project with objectives of writing inputs into a file and save them.

### Objective :
- The program asks the user if he wants to read, write or delete in the file.
  - If he wants to read, the program outputs everything saved in the file.
  - If he wants to write, a ReadLine allows him to input lines in a while loop until he presses specific key combos.
  - If he wants to delete, the program asks for a line number which it will delete afterward.
---
### Specs :
- Written lines are added one after another and not replaced.
- Deleted lines cannot be null or out of existing lines.
